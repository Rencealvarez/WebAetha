# Museum Content Management System Setup

This document provides instructions for setting up and using the Museum Content Management System for the Aeta Museum Exhibition.

## Overview

The Museum Content Management System allows administrators to:

- Manage traditional artifacts with 3D models and descriptions
- Update cultural heritage information (languages, festivals, rituals)
- Manage living culture gallery (videos and multimedia content)
- Upload and manage images for artifacts and videos

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the SQL Script

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `museum_database_setup.sql`
4. Run the script to create all necessary tables and sample data

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Storage
2. Create a new bucket named `museum-images`
3. Set the bucket to public
4. Enable Row Level Security (RLS)

## Features

3. Use the tabbed interface to manage different content types

### Permissions

- **Image Storage**: Uses Supabase storage with public access

## Content Structure

  "englishText": "Detailed English description",
  "aetaText": "Detailed Aeta language description",
  "imageUrl": "Image URL or uploaded file",
  "category": "hunting|clothing|jewelry|ceremonial|domestic"
}
```

### Languages

## Frontend Integration

The museum exhibition page (`AetaMuseumExhibition.js`) automatically:

- Fetches content from the database
- Displays artifacts with 3D models and real images
- Shows cultural heritage information in organized tabs
- Displays living culture videos with thumbnails
- Falls back to default content if database is unavailable

## File Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MuseumContentManagement.js    # Main admin interface
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AdminLayout.js                # Updated with museum content link
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AetaMuseumExhibition.js           # Updated to use database
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js                                # Updated with new route
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ museum_database_setup.sql             # Database setup script
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**

   - Verify Supabase credentials in `src/supabase.js`
   - Check if tables exist in the database
   - Ensure RLS policies are properly configured

2. **Image Upload Failures**

   - Verify storage bucket exists and is public
   - Check file size limits
   - Ensure proper file permissions

3. **Content Not Loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify database policies allow read access
   - Check if sample data was inserted correctly

### Performance Tips

- Use appropriate image sizes for thumbnails
- Optimize 3D models for web viewing
- Consider implementing pagination for large content lists
- Use CDN for frequently accessed images

## Security Considerations

- All content is publicly readable
- Only authenticated users can modify content
- Image uploads are restricted to image file types
- RLS policies ensure proper access control
- No sensitive information should be stored in this system

## Future Enhancements

- Content versioning and history
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Advanced search and filtering
- Content approval workflows
- Multi-language support expansion
- Analytics and usage tracking

## Support
